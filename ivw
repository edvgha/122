unique_ptr always owns what it points to
to assign a raw pointer won't compile
---------------------------------------
std::shared_ptrs are twice the size of a raw pointer
Memory for the reference count must be dynamically allocated
Increments and decrements of the reference count must be atomic
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
std::make_shared always creates a control block
A control block is created when a std::shared_ptr is constructed from a unique-ownership pointer
Whenastd::shared_ptrconstructoriscalledwitharawpointer,itcreatesa control block
std::shared_ptr constructors taking std::shared_ptrs or std::weak_ptrs as constructor arguments donâ€™t create new control blocks
