Let N denote the average number of packets in the buffer plus the packet being transmitted (packet)

Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at the link (packet/msec)

Let d denote the average total delay (msec)

Little’s formula is N = a · d

N = 10 packet;
queue-delay = 10 msec;
transmission-rate = 100 packet/sec

a = (N + 1) / d;

d = d_queue + d_transmission = 10 + 10

=> 11 / 20;
