application - message
transport   - segment (transports messages from application layer)
network     - datagram (moving datagrams from one host to another)
              delivering the segment to the trasport layer in the destination host
link        - frame (deliver datagram though link to next router/destination)
physical    - move individual bits from one node to next

error recovery can be duplicated by layers
