circuit - guaranteed constant rate
          dedicated end to end connection between two hosts

640.000 bits

TDM 24 slots , bit rate 1.536 Mbps
500 msec - end-to-end connection establish

each circuit - (1.536 Mbps) / 24 = 64 Kbps => (640.000 bits / 64 Kbps) = 10 second

=> finally 10 + 0.5  = 10.5

packet switching - better sharing of transmission capacity

TDM vs FDM in TDM we can use full band
